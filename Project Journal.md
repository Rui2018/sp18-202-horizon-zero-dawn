### What I did since the last weekly scrum:

1. What I did since the last weekly scrum:

### What I plan to do:

1. Discuss with my team members and decide what game we plane to build and the basic rules of the game.
2. Once decided, start to build basic classes needed for the game and choose a design pattern that suit our game. 

### What blockers I have:

1. First scrum, so no blockers yet. 



# Horizon-Zero-Dawn, Sprint #2

## Team member name:

Nanzhu Zhang

### What I did since the last weekly scrum:

1. Decided to build game scenario 2 which will include instructions which will show the players how to play the game. 
2. Choose proxy design pattern for our game. That is only the players who paid for the game(have the password to the game) will be able to enter the game. 


### What I plan to do:

1. Implement the scenario 2, add instructions in the appropriate location. 
2. Build the frame of proxy design pattern.
3. Complete the class diagram of proxy design pattern. 

### What blockers I have:


# Horizon-Zero-Dawn, Sprint #3

## Team member name:

Nanzhu Zhang

### What I did since the last weekly scrum:

1. Added all the instructions for the players. 
2. Make the instructions disappear if the jumper passed through. 
3. Added a TitleScreen to the game which implements the proxy interface. 
4. Added a dialog box to interact with the player so the input can be read in from the player to verify the password. 
5. Proxy class diagram. 


### What I plan to do:

1. Complete the instruction, change the format so it suits the game.
2. Change the rules of this scenario so it will be easier than the rest scenarios.
3. Complete the proxy part. Check password entered by the player, if right enter the game otherwise stay in this page. 
4. Complete use case and sequence diagram of the “enter the game” use case. 


### What blockers I have:

1. Tried several different strategies but still cannot make the instructions be invisible at the beginning and then appear when the jumper getting closer.
2. The cancel button in the popup screen will cause problem.
